# Flask_createApp

A powerful Flask project generator with extensible templates.

A better readme will be made after I fully decide how to progress this project and what I have in mind, no point making a good readme if I might change major things later on.
If you do want to learn more (for some reason) message me on discord: fazpy


To add your templates, create a new folder into the templates directory in app and then put in template(s) in there
thats all you have to do if you dont want to add settings

if you do, follow these steps:
The Templategroupname is the folder you created in app/templates

inside of templateoptions.json add this:
"templategroupname-Global": {
    "Option name": "functionName"
}
this will apply to all the templates inside then group

or you can do
"templateName": {
   "Option name": "functionName"
}
this will only apply to this singular template

then inside of template_functions.py
create a function named functionName with two arguements
